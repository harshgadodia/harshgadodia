In my second last semester in NUS as a computer engineering major, I decided to enrol in CS2102, database systems. 

There were several things I was looking forward to while taking the class, but none more so than the opportunity to work in a group on a real project. CS2102 was notorious amongst computing students for having tough project requirements. 

I was excited to present the project to the teaching team at the end of the semester, especially having spent many sleepless nights working with my teammates on the project. While I was initially very excited to work on the project, working on it made me feel unsatisfied because I was not really free to be creative, I was at liberty of strict grading rubrics and concrete requirements.

I was offered an opportunity to intern for a year in California in my second semester of year 2. I simply couldn’t refuse. The timing couldn’t have been better; having completed three semesters in NUS and having taken most of my core requirements related to my core interests, software engineering. I thought being in an actual working environment couldn’t be more beneficial to my learning.

I took up an offer to work at Epic! (www.getepic.com), a small start-up trying to revolutionise reading for kids between the ages of 5-12. They made reading for kids fun, and offered tens of thousands of books and other educational material virtually on iOS, Android, and computers through a beautiful, interactive experience. 

Being part of a start-up was challenging in many ways. For one, it requires you to wear many hats. A small company trying to make a big impact means that every employee is expected to work hard and move fast. Job scopes are often blurred to meet time lines. At the same time, I was fortunate to be part of a company that valued my time and respected my expectations to leave a better software engineer a year later; I was not made to do saikang (unpleasant and undesirable tasks) at all, and was treated like an equal. I was given liberty to choose the projects I wanted to part of based on my own interests, a true privilege.

Being part of a team making a consumer-facing product, and that too for kids, meant that perfecting user interface and user experience (UI/UX) was paramount.

An immense amount of thought and planning went into designing even simple screens; let alone advanced features. One of my first tasks at Epic! was to engineer a quiz feature for kids. Having come from an academic background and this being my first internship, I was puzzled by the lack of concrete requirements, instead being guided by my own gut feel (along with lots of helpful guidance from senior engineers).

The end goal was to produce a feature (and by extension, an experience) that kids would love. That meant not just designing for kids, but also putting the child at the centre of the user experience. I was initially taken aback by how seriously this exercise was taken, especially because I was used to presenting my projects to teaching assistants and professors. This was different; my graders were the million children who used the product daily. This felt exhilarating.

I see the two experiences of working for the database project and interning as dichotomous. Working on a school project, even if designed to mimic real-world requirements,  is fundamentally different from working in the real world.  Before interning at Epic!, I was not even aware of what the industry was looking for, and one-year at a start-up with top-notch technology standards really opened my eyes to the disconnect between academia and reality in the field of software engineering.

My database project, while designed for (mock) entrepreneurs and investors, was to be graded by university teaching staff. The same project was being pursued by a hundred other students; year after year. While my group and I tried to put users at the centre of the experience, we knew that it was the teaching team we had to please at the end of the day. It didn’t matter if we had the coolest designs or the most interactive work flow, our fate was to be decided by someone who had probably graded the same project year after year. We designed to catch his eye, and not to please the user. Furthermore, in the name of “fairness”, the project scope was extremely narrow - everyone had the same strict requirements, the same checkboxes they wanted ticked off. This is boring, stifles creativity, and is against the end goal of preparing students for the real world.

This was immensely different from my task at Epic!, where I was required to engineer a kick-ass experience for a million actual users. The database project required little creativity, one could even argue that being too creative would lead to a penalty for not meeting requirements. On the other hand, creativity was at the soul of the quiz feature at Epic!. 
The NUS vision, mission, and values are noble. They seem to at the very least, hint at preparing students for the workplace (thought the mission to educate, inspire and transform). However, along with these goals, NUS also shoulders the responsibility of fundamentally being an academic institution that is expected to fairly grade its students. There is a need to quantify the quality of its graduates in a fair yet competitive manner, lest its ranking in the world university surveys fall.

The university takes an anamorphic view of class projects - while their end goal is to train for the workplace, the very act of coming up with and sticking to “fair” grading metrics means that little space is left for creativity. In my opinion, NUS, and most other universities in the world that follow a similar traditional grading scheme, should start to cut back on their grading rubrics, and instead allow students to apply knowledge in less restrictive way. Yes, that means that subjectivity is introduced into grades, but hey, who said the world out there is objective to begin with?

Ironic, but take the example of this very writing assignment; with the noble goal of asking students to reflect on two transformative learning experiences, but with a word limit of 1000 words. Definitely designed to ease grading and perhaps give students a better understanding of requirements, but perhaps penalising students who have more to say, or those who can say more with less. A box on creativity.

Moving forward, I hope to always take requirements with a bushel of salt. As a software engineering aspirant with entrepreneurial dreams, I constantly remind myself that Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Twitter, Grab, were not born out of requirements. As a matter of fact, many such disruptors practically danced at the line between legality and breaking the law when they first began. This does not however, mean that I completely disregard rules in place and project requirements - they have their place. But, to change the world (or at least scratch at the surface), I know I have to think much, much bigger.
