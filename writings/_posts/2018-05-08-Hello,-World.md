#### Motivation

Lying on the bed at 4am watching Netflix made me realise: I'm a bum and all I do is *consume* content. I thought it'd be great for me to *produce* content once in a while too. I hope to use this space on the web to share content that I have created - writings, commentaries, maybe a few drawings here and there. Cheers!
