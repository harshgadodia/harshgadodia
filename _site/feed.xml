&lt;p&gt;“Our process is a student-centered process, not a school or region centered process. This means that we do not read your application along with other students from your school or region to compare you against each other; each applicant stands on their own. We have no quotas by school, state, or region. You are not at any disadvantage if other excellent students from your school or area are also applying. We also do not consider legacy/alumni relations in our process.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harsh Gadodia</name><email>me@harshgadodia.com</email></author><summary type="html">I’ve never seen an admissions process purer than the one MIT claims to have:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This Is America</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/This-is-America/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This Is America" /><published>2019-07-02T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-07-02T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/This-is-America</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/This-is-America/">&lt;p&gt;2017 was an eye-opening year for me, having had the chance to live half the world away in the states for a year. When I look back to the year, I can think of many great memories - but if I try to think of the one thing that really represented America to me, it would be a humble wooden sign outside the shared swimming pool near my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The use of alcohol and drugs in the pool is &lt;strong&gt;not encouraged&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They are an absolute engineering marvel, the best in the world at safety, punctuality, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been zero fatalities aboard the bullet trains in over fifty years of operation, the trains travel at close to 300 km/h, and the average annual delay per train is 0.9 minutes, &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trains are representative of the Japanese culture in many ways, including a radical thirst for perfection and a devotion to craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
