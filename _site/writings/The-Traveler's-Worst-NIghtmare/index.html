I would be lying if I said I am able to type this article without spell-checker and auto-correct doing some very heavy lifting. I’m tired, hungry, and hallucinating. Plus, I can smell myself.</h2>

<p><em>In the past 48 hours, my friend and I have experienced 2 of probably the worst possible things that can happen to a tourist - getting our belongings stolen, and getting a flight canceled without being re-booked.</em></p>

<p>The nightmare began on the 27th of July in the evening in Brussels, Belgium. Having spent the previous night at the Athens airport to save some dough, my friend and I were already pretty tired. We had wrapped up a pretty awesome day walking around Brussels, and had especially enjoyed an insightful tour at the European Parliament in Brussels. Having had a nice, heavy dinner in Pizza Hut, we wanted to get a couple of Belgian beers and sit in the city centre, and just chill for a bit. That night was going to become another night at the airport, and our flight was the following morning at 6.30am.</p>

<p>We decided to play Heads-up to kill some time (and decide who would get the next round) after finding a park bench to sit on. Our bags were between us on the bench, and my pal Shubz left his DSLR camera on the other side of his body, well within arms’ length. While playing the game, we saw someone come and sit beside him, and he left after a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>After a couple of rounds in, Shubz said that he wanted to check on our belongings, and that’s when we realized it - the camera was gone. We think the man who sat beside us was of African descent because of his skin tone. Thousands of dollars of equipment gone, but infinitesimal compared to what was inside the camera - almost all our pictures from the past month of this trip. Hundreds of hours spent in the hot sun by Shubz over the past month, all gone just like that. For me, taking pictures whilst traveling has always been to serve as a physical take-away, but to Shubz, photography was the end-goal of this month in Europe. I travel to see new places and broaden my horizon, and sometimes take pictures to share with others. Shubz, however, travels to take photos. He plans his entire day around where he needs to be at what time in the day to take that perfect shot. He climbs fences into private properties, jumps over barricades, and camps in the hot sun with hundreds of like-minded tourists around him, all for that perfect shot. He wakes up early in the morning to catch sunrises, and often goes to spots late at night to take night shots. All that effort, all gone, just like that. In broad daylight, too.</p>

<p><em>Shubz, if you’re reading this, I have no words to express how terrible I feel, but I know that I don’t know the half of it. I know it could have well been me instead of you having had something stolen. I also hope that you this incident does not scare you in any way with regards to traveling, or diminishes that crazy passion for photography in your soul. It’s an inspiration to me, and I’m sure to many others. Keep at it buddy, and I’m sorry.</em></p>

<p>To top it off, the Belgian police were absolutely useless. I tried to coerce them to follow me to the site so that they could see for themselves the site of the crime, but they instead told me to head back there myself and call the police hotline if we see the suspect. Because he’ll obviously be in the area after stealing the camera, right? They titled the police report as “Black camera strap stolen” and refuse to add the model number or camera serial number to the report. I think they think that we were wasting their time reporting this crime, and clearly were not taking us seriously. When we went to check on the status of the investigations the next day, the policemen stared at us <em>as if it was their job to investigate crime and help people.</em></p>

<p>We grudgingly made our to the airport after that, reaching around 11pm for a 6.30am flight. We barely spoke to each other, me because I didn’t know what to say to make Shubz feel better, and Shubz because the most important thing in his life was taken away from him hours ago, with perhaps nothing to grasp onto.</p>

<p>We found a quiet spot in the airport to lie down, and did so hugging our bags. We <strong>did not</strong> want any more drama. We just wanted to reach Copenhagen with everything we had with us, and wanted to shower and sleep after 2 days of not being able to do so. <strong>Was that too much to ask?</strong> At 6am, after some uncomfortable hours of awkward rest on a cold floor, we saw that our Ryanair flight was canceled. We were given no information on why it was canceled, but <em>thankfully, someone from Ryanair gave us pieces of paper that said our flight was canceled, and that we should just rebook ourselves online, without bothering them. And their website was down.</em></p>

<p>After standing in a line for about an hour with other angry passengers, we were told that the earliest flight to Copenhagen we could be put on was on Wednesday, 4 days later. I was supposed to be in Singapore by then, let alone Copenhagen, or my final stop, Stockholm. We knew Ryanair had a reputation, and chose to just get a refund, all 20 Euros of it each.</p>

<p>We spent the next few hours trying to find alternative ways to reach Copenhagen. After all, we had already paid for 2 nights in a very expensive hostel in Copenhagen, and then a train from there to Stockholm. Trying to get ourselves a flight on the same day was one of the most stressful situations I’d ever been in. Fares were going up, literally every minute. We eventually settled on a 300-Euro flight to Copenhagen via Frankfurt - a 15 hour journey in total. Ours initially was less than 2 hours, and 15 times cheaper. Well, what choice did we have, right? And nothing else, could go wrong, right?</p>

<p><strong>Wrong.</strong> We found out around noon, seven hours before our replacement flight, that our flight tickets were canceled because of bank authorization issues (or so kiwi.com claims) and we were going to be given a refund. Yay, another refund. And now we had less than half the time to make another booking, and flights were on average, about 1000 Euros to Copenhagen. Clearly, the benevolent, all-knowing being was having his/her/their fun with us. We eventually booked a flight directly to Stockholm, skipping Copenhagen together, at 20 times the original cost of the ticket to Copenhagen. We also wasted two nights of hostel stays, train tickets, and the opportunity to explore Copenhagen, something I was really looking forward to.</p>

<p>As I type this, I’m sitting in an airport in Warsaw, Poland. When checking in at Belgium, we were told by staff the system said our final stop was not Stockholm but Berlin or something, I can’t even remember. I didn’t know if to laugh, cry, scream, or just wish that I combusted into carbon. Fortunately, it was a mistake. I have 10 hours to kill before my next flight. I have neither the will, nor the energy, nor the money to leave the airport. All I’m doing is praying for no more surprises. I’ve been told that this is the <em>fun</em> of traveling. Please pray my check-in bags make it to Stockholm at the same time as me as well, I really need to shower.</p>

<p><em>Friends, always make sure to watch out for your belongings when traveling. In Singapore, we take this for granted. Over my month in Europe, we heard of many cases of people’s belongings being stolen from the bags on their bodies, from the airport while they were sleeping next to it, or in front of their eyes. Someone in Belgium next to me at the police station even had their car stolen, with all their belongings, passport, documents, everything inside of it. Also, while flight delays and cancellations cannot be prevented, it makes sense to know your rights as a passenger when they do, and have purchased travel insurance to share some of the blow when shit hits the fan.</em></p>
