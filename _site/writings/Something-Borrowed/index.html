      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">Something Borrowed</h1>
    
    <p>I’ve always loved animals. It’s part of the reason that I’m vegetarian, and I’m fascinated by how they can co-exist with each other (and sometimes humans in the case of pets and farm animals) without the ability to talk to express complex ideas. Naturally, I was elated when a friend of my mom requested that we take care of her 4-year-old <a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/maltipoo#/slide/1">Maltipoo</a>, Fluffy, for a few weeks.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fluffy.jpg" width="100000000" /></p>

<p>(If you already have a dog, much of what I have to say will have little to no added value to you)</p>

<p>Having always wanted a dog and failing to have convinced my parents on multiple occasions to get our own, I was especially excited to have him home. These were some of my observations.</p>

<p>Dogs are incredibly loving. Incredibly loyal, I have now experienced for myself how they have cemented their place as man’s best friend. I’ve never seen anyone happier (and I don’t think I ever will) than Fluffy was every time I returned home. I think this is because, to him, I have safely returned after leaving our territory. Furthermore, Fluffy would someone know if anyone from my family (and for a short 2 weeks, his) would be behind the door. Before we were even 5 feet away from the door, Fluffy would start barking to make sure someone would open the door as soon as possible. This is curious because I doubt our smell would make it past the door from a distance, and he wouldn’t be barking if it was the neighbours walking to the door adjacent to ours.</p>

<p>Dogs ask for very little from you, but give you so much in return. Fluffy would only need to be walked a couple of times a day, and be given food. However, in return he would follow you around the house, making sure you are fine. He would somehow be able to sense if I was stressed, and would come and gently sit next to my feet, watching me and making sure I was okay. He would also be awake much before I would, but would be silently and patiently waiting for me to wake up at my bedside. He would greet me by climbing onto the bed and licking me.</p>

<p>We loved taking care of Fluffy (or rather Fluffy taking care of us) so much that we picked him up again in a few weeks when his two of his owners were going overseas. He stayed with us for a week. It was painful to drop him back home today. Over the few weeks with us, I have also seen that Fluffy has begun to trust us more, now comfortable falling deep into sleep in our laps, and letting us carry him around the house without fearing that we might drop him (which was a big gear for him when we first got him).</p>

<p>The bond that I have developed with Fluffy over a short three weeks is not commensurate to the length of time he has stayed with us. I can only imagine how strong a bond is between dogs and owners who live with each other for years, or over the dog’s lifetime. To a dog, you truly are his everything. I don’t think people who don’t have dogs will ever understand what it feels like to own one. Admittedly, I don’t too, but I definitely believe that life is insipid without a dog living with you.</p>
