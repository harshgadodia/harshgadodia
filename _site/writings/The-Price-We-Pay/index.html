      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">The Price We Pay</h1>
    
    <p>I was in a good mood today, heading to terminal 4 (Changi Airport Singapore) for a short vacation in Bali. The shuttle bus from terminal 3 was packed with equally excited travellers, most of which seemed to be Singaporean based on their looks and accents.</p>

<p>When the bus arrived at the terminal, people (naturally) started to rush towards the exit to alight. No one wants to be last in a situation like this! However, it made me really sad that no one would give way to a family of three, one of whom was a small baby in a pram. The father, who alighted first, was carrying a light blue bag of baby supplies, and I assumed people would wait for the mother (who was right behind) to follow next with the baby in the pram.</p>

<p>However, what happened instead is that people saw the mother with a pram as an opportunity to cut ahead of a slower passenger. The mother smiled in dismay, and I could see on her face that this was not the first time. I was a little shocked, but having grown up in Singapore, it was sadly not that surprising. (More on this below)</p>

<p>I wished that I had the courage to reprimand those people and say something. Perhaps I will the next time?</p>

<p>Singapore, a small city-state with people as its only natural resource, is fiercely competitive. We are, from young, taught that the most opportunities will be offered to those who perform the best. From streaming students based on their performances in specific to classes starting at just grade 2 (students in better classes are assigned the most senior teachers and given access to the best facilities like science labs), to testing all Singaporean students at grade 6 for admission into secondary schools into schools (the better schools have facilities like softball courts, rugby fields, and a full stadium with a running track while others may not even have a single grass field for students to play soccer on), Singaporeans are no strangers to a “meritocratic” society, where you are rewarded based on your performance and contribution.</p>

<p>Singapore has a pathological need to be efficient and fair in everything it does, and Singaporeans have been trained from young to fit into the larger puzzle that is the Singapore society without showing dissent. Those who go against the flow are punished by the government, or not taken seriously by society. The need to follow the rules is instilled in every Singaporean, but only at the cost of courtesy and sometimes, practicality. For example, my experience driving in Singapore has been that while most drivers are law-abiding, rarely would one be given way when changing lanes. Not only that, cars would intentionally speed up when they see someone trying to filter into their lane. I realised this was worse for new drivers, who had a probation plate on their car. Others would see this as an opportunity to bully, and would generally make matter worse for you by not giving you the space you need to change lanes. I actually removed my probation plate when I realised this was the case. Cars generally do not stop for pedestrians if there is no crosswalk, even if the person trying to cross the road is a mother with a young child or an old person. Many pedestrians are surprised when I give them way to cross the road.</p>

<p>In the trains (called MRTs) in Singapore, every carriage has a few seats reserved for the needy - elderly, the handicapped, pregnant women, and the like. These seats are usually taken up by the deserving, and sometimes by others if no one is qualified enough to sit on it .  However, it is rare for someone who is not on a reserved seat to give up their seat to someone more deserving. Elevators at the train stations are used in the order of those who came to the elevator to queue up first, even if there is someone more deserving at the end of the queue. Of course, this is not always the case.</p>

<p>Singapore’s messiah, the government, does, of course, step in to solve the problem. In government grocery stores, seniors can skip the queue when paying for food. More reserved seats are being created in trains to match Singapore’s rapidly ageing population. Signs are put up in public places to remind people to be courteous to each other. However, is this form of contrived courtesy really the best measure in the long run? I think not.</p>

<p>Courtesy needs to come from within. If we continue to manufacture courtesy in Singapore, I think we will forget as a people it’s not of those things that we are instructed to do.</p>
