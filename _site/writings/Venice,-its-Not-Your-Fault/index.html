      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">Venice, Its Not Your Fault</h1>
    
    <p>I don’t have to tell you that Venice is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. What you might not know is that it is suffering with too many tourists, to the point that it’s threatening the city’s very existence. Venice may soon both lose it’s status as a UNESCO world heritage site and enter the “In-Danger List”, normally reserved for ruins in third-world countries.</p>

<p><em>A short history</em></p>

<p><em>The independent “Most Scenic Republic of Venice” (yes, that is the actual name) existed from the 8th century to the 18th century. The Doge’s Palace was built in 814, and landmark St Mark’s Basilica in 834. (This Basilica had been burnt down and has been reconstructed.) The celebrated Venetian merchant Marco Polo sailed to China in one of the most fascinating stories of the middle ages in 1271. In 1348, Venice’s population halved because of the plague. Venice enjoyed being one of the largest trading ports in the world in it’s heyday, but declined in 1797 because it could not defend itself, with only 13 ships and a few brigades of mercenaries.</em></p>

<p>Incredibly rude waiters, shop-owners, and everyday people led me thinking and researching about why Venetians despise tourists so much. 
This was especially surprising because tourism runs this city, and Venice needs tourists like our bodies need water. A city of about 55,000 locals, Venice sees up to 300,000 tourists in a weekend alone. Venetians have raised issues that range from vandalism and destruction of historical sites, unaffordable housing, bathing (sometimes completely naked) in historical fountains of cultural and religious significance, and crowding on public bridges and transport that lead to a severe degradation of their lives. One can view posters that say “Tourists go away” in the city.</p>

<p>The city has been fighting hard to combat the woes of over-tourism, and keep locals staying in the city. If the population of Venice drops below 40,000, it will be unsustainable as a city. The city already has a Venetians-first policy, and presenting a ‘Venezia Unica Oro’, or gold card, gets you priority boarding on boats (this is a huge perk because boats tend to be extremely crowded). Boats cost 6 times more for tourists on a single-ticket, and are 50 Euros for 3 days for tourists and 50 Euros for 5 years for locals. The city also practices tourist pricing, where virtually everything is priced (read: overpriced) for tourists. Proving you’re local will get you a much cheaper bottle of coke, meal, or any form of service at the same establishment. Entry fees for monuments, museums, and other attractions, which can range from 5 - 30 Euros, also only apply to tourists. It is clear that Venetians come first in Venice.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the city has launched a #EnjoyRespectVenice campaign, which provides instructions on how to behave here as a tourist. Instructions to be followed include not sitting down in public spaces for meals or to picnic, not crossing a bridge without purpose (taking photos is not an acceptable purpose), and not standing on the street without motivation. Having bought some take-away pasta at a stall in Venice, we were given strict instructions after being served on where we were allowed to <em>stand</em> and eat. Sitting was out of the question.</p>

<p>One major problem that Venice faces is a large number of cruise ships that dock here and send tourists to visit for the day. These tourists do not stay overnight and hence do that support hotels. Cruises also have meals included, so they have no motivation to eat here ias well. In 2016, protesters used boats to form a line and prevent cruise ships from entering the lagoon.</p>

<p>Clearly what has been done to save Venice from too many tourists is not enough, and there are many ideas being floated to help the situation. This includes charging tourists a daily fee for being in Venice, much like Disneyland. A fee in the range of 100 Euros or so is likely to start to curb the number of tourists that enter Venice. Mayors in the past have also requested for the power to close off the city on days with too many tourists. However, because Venice is completely dependent on tourism for its survival, closing off the city for a prolonged period is not an option.</p>

<p>Whatever the solution is, Venetians better think hard and fast, the city is sinking 2mm a year - and will possibly be underwater a century from now. It’s not her fault she’s so beautiful - and I have pictures to prove it.</p>
