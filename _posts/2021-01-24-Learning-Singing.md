24 January 2021

I've been learning singing for the better part of a year now. When someone asked me today how I knew if I was getting better, I was intrigued. The question brought me on a journey back to when I first started.

I reflected on the different stages I've been through whilst learning singing from scratch, and here is a short list on how I think I know I'm getting better.

I think I'm between Points 2 and 3, so Points 4-6 are speculative, meaning that I have not reached those stages. This is how I imagine myself gauging my skills when I reach there. I'm curious to know if and how this list changes when I get there.

1. **Finding your singing voice.**
  I started off with practicing what I thought was singing along to songs, but recording myself made me realise that I was just saying the words. Figuring out the difference between saying stuff and singing was the first milestone.

2. **Singing a song, along with the singer’s voice, thinking you sound good.**
   The second step was singing (in my singing voice) along to a song, thinking I sounded alright.

   Not having the ears to differentiate between good and bad singing, I was having a good time thinking I sounded good.

3. **Singing a song, along with the singer’s voice, knowing you don’t sound good.**
  The next step is all about being able to hear the nuances in the singer's voice and how it differs to mine. Hint: there were a lot of differences.

4. **Singing a song, along with the singer’s voice, knowing you do sound good.**
   This distant milestone involves both being able to both hear nuances in music and physically able to sing in tune.

5. **Singing a song, without the singer’s voice,  but with the background music (just like karaoke), and sounding good.**

6. **Being able to sing without any music and sounding good.**
  I've tried recording myself listening to music through earphones but singing into a mic before, I was harrowed. I know it's normal to be [jarred by the sound of your own voice](https://time.com/4820247/voice-vocal-cords/#:~:text=People%20perceive%20their%20own%20voice,voice%20you're%20used%20to.), but boy was that an experience. It'll probably take years to reach this stage.

I'm excited for the next steps in my journey.
