2 July 2019

2017 was an eye-opening year for me, having had the chance to live half the world away in the states for a year. When I look back to the year, I can think of many great memories - but if I try to think of the one thing that really represented America to me, it would be a humble wooden sign outside the shared swimming pool near my apartment.

*The use of alcohol and drugs in the pool is **not encouraged***.
