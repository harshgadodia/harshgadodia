My name is Harsh. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co/en-sg/about-us).

I was born in India, but grew up in Singapore, where I served in the army as part of National Service from 2013-2014. I graduated in 2019 from the National University of Singapore. I majored in Computer Engineering, and was also a part of a liberal arts programme called the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg). I spent my second year of college interning as an iOS developer at [Epic!](www.getepic.com), an educational technology start-up in the SF Bay Area.
