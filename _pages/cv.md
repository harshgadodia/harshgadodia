## Technical Projects 

# [FoodExchange](https://devpost.com/software/foodexchange?fbclid=IwAR0KADWTi152ubpGoIBWfJWgHBGO-S2p8IXbts03omeVnfJUqYRfu6Xc1bc)

FoodExchange allows college students to buy and sell unused meal credits. It consists of a telegram bot and a React web application. The telegram bot is written entirely in Python using the telegram bot API, while the web app is built using ReactJS, HTML5/CSS, and NodeJS. The database was built using NoSQL on firebase. 

You can view the code [here](https://github.com/harshgadodia/FoodExchange)

# Karina

Karina is a (working prototype) AI personal assistant built from scratch for Singapore's largest IVF centre. 

It is built completely using cloud services, including AWS tools such as Cognito, S3, lambda, SES, SNS, CloudWatch, Lex, VPC and RDS. It is compliant to hospital privacy and availabity guidelines. We (myself and a team of 2 others) have been approached by the IVF centre to build a live version of this, and also by other departments in the hospital to solve technical challenges for them.

# [Chope God](https://devpost.com/software/chope-god)

Chope God is an iOS application that allows users to drop a virtual pin and reserve venues. Users of the application can see if a venue is reserved in real-time through the application - a red pin floats in the air above reserved venues. It uses Apple's ARKit, CoreLocation, and a firebase back-end.

# [FoodHero](https://github.com/harshgadodia/food-hero)

FoodHero allows event organisers to donate food left over after big events. One can use a Facebook messenger bot to interact with the service. Computer vision is used to estimate the quantity of food available. A website displays food available for charities to choose from.

# IvoryTasks

IvoryTasks is a command-line based tasked manager for quick and easy task management.

# Sharity

Sharity allows Facebook users to indirectly donate to a cause they believe in. This is done by supporting companies that pledge to donate money to charities through likes, comments, and shares. Just a few months after this idea was pitched to Facebook executives as part of a Hackathon, Facebook launched something very similar officially.

# TombBook

There are millions of profiles of dead people on Facebook. TombBook automatically and intelligently turns a deceased's Facebook profile into a memorial page. An intelligent messenger bot delivers timed messages from the deceased to his or her loved ones.
