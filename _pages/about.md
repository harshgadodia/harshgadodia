### Hello there, and welcome to my website. 

### I am a [Computer Engineering](http://www.ceg.nus.edu.sg/admissions/exploreceg.html#what) Senior (Year 4) at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) (NUS). I am also part of the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP) at NUS, a selective multi-disciplinary honors program. I will be graduating in May 2019. I am part of the organising team of The Sessions, USP's premier platform for conversations about topics ranging from politics, to technology, to everyday affairs. I spent all of 2017 interning at a children's educational technology company called [Epic!](http://www.getepic.com), where I worked primarily as an iOS developer. You can view my latest CV at this [page](https://harshgadodia.com/cv/).

### My main interests are programming, writing, travelling, hacking, current affairs, reading, and soccer.
