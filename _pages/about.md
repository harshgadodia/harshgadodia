My name is Harsh. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co).

I was born in India, but grew up in Singapore, where I served in the army as part of National Service between 19 and 20. I graduated in 2019 from the National University of Singapore, where I majored in Computer Engineering. I was also a part of a liberal arts programme called the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg). I spent my second year of college interning as an iOS developer at [Epic!](www.getepic.com), an educational technology start-up in the Bay Area.
