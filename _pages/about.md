My name is Harsh. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co), Southeast Asia's largest last-mile logistics company, and one of the region's most disruptive start-ups.

I was born in India, but grew up in Singapore, where I served in the army as part of National Service between 19 and 20. I graduated in 2019 from the National University of Singapore (NUS), where I majored in Computer Engineering. I spent my second year of college interning as an iOS developer at [Epic!](www.getepic.com), an educational technology start-up in California. I was also a part of a liberal arts honours college programme called the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) at NUS.

My main interests outside of technology and entrepreneurship are reading, writing, traveling, and sports.
