### Hello there! 

### I am a [Computer Engineering](http://www.ceg.nus.edu.sg/admissions/exploreceg.html#what) Senior (Year 4) at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) (NUS). I am also part of the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP) at NUS, a selective multi-disciplinary honors program. I will be graduating in May 2019. I was co-head of [The Sessions](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/life-at-usp/interest-groups/239-the-sessions), USP's premier platform for conversations about topics ranging from politics and ethics, to technology, to everyday affairs. I spent 2017 interning at a children's educational technology company called [Epic!](http://www.getepic.com), where I worked primarily as an iOS developer. You can view my latest CV at this [page](https://harshgadodia.com/cv/).

### My main interests are programming/[hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) (not [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker)), writing, travelling, current affairs, reading and soccer.
