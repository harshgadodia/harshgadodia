### Hello there, and welcome to my website. 

### I am a Computer Engineering Senior at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) (NUS). I am also a scholar under the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP) at NUS. I will be graduating in May 2019.  I am part of the organising team of The Sessions, USP's premier platform for conversations about topics ranging from politics, to technology, to everyday affairs. I spent all of 2018 interning at a company called [Epic!](www.getepic.com), where I worked primarily as an iOS developer.

### My main interests are programming, writing, travelling, hacking (I love participating in hackathons), current affairs, reading, and soccer.
