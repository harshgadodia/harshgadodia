### Hello there! 

### I am a [Computer Engineering](http://www.ceg.nus.edu.sg/admissions/exploreceg.html#what) Senior (Year 4) at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg) (NUS).

<a name="quotes"></a>

- What I would like to have is that we be blessed with a divine discontent. Always not quite satisfied with what we have, always driven to do better. (Lee Hsien Loong)

- “And still, after all this time,  
The sun never says to the earth,  
"You owe Me."  
Look what happens with  
A love like that,  
It lights the Whole Sky.” (Hafiz, Persian Poet (1317-1390)

- "An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field." ( Niels Bohr)

- "The best writing is rewriting." (E. B. White)

- "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." (Abelson & Sussman)

- “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” (Norman Vincent Peale)

- “The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages are equivalent is that it's not true. But the advantage is that it makes your life a lot simpler. And I think that's the main reason the idea is so widespread. It is a comfortable idea.” (Paul Graham)

- “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” (David Attenborough)

- “There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.” (Yuval Noah Harari)
