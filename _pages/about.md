### Hello there, and welcome to my website. 

### I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I am also a scholar under the University Scholars Programme (USP) at NUS. I will be graduating in May, 2019.  I am part of the organising team of The Sessions, USP's premier platform for conversations about topics ranging from politics, to technology, to everyday affairs.  

### In my free time, I love to code, travel, peruse the news, rhyme (see what I did there), and sleep! I also enjoy writing opinionated articles, and share memes with friends.
