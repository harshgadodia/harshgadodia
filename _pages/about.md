My name is Harsh. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co), Southeast Asia's largest last-mile logistics company.

I grew up in Singapore, where I served in the army as part of National Service between 19 and 20. I graduated in 2019 from the National University of Singapore, where I majored in Computer Engineering. I was also a part of the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP). At USP, I co-headed The Sessions, USP's premier platform for conversations about topics people cared about.  

I spent my second year of university interning at [Epic!](www.getepic.com), an educational technology start-up in California. I worked primarily as an iOS developer. 

My main interests outside of technology are reading, writing, traveling, and sports.
