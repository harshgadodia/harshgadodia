Hello there! My name is Harsh. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co), Southeast Asia's largest and fastest growing last-mile logistics company.

I grew up in Singapore, where I served in the army as part of National Service for 2 years between 19 and 20. I graduated summer 2019 from the National University of Singapore, where I studied Computer Engineering. At NUS, I was also moonlighting as an arts student at the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP). At USP, I co-headed [The Sessions](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/life-at-usp/interest-groups/239-the-sessions), USP's premier platform for conversations about topics including (but not limited to) politics, ethics, technology, transport, sustainability, and education. 

I spent sophomore year of university living in California and interning at an EdTech start-up, where I was primarily an iOS developer.

My main interests are programming and technology, reading (non-fiction books, articles, essays, current affairs), writing, traveling, and sports.
