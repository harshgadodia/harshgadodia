Hey there! My name is Harsh. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](https://www.ninjavan.co), Southeast Asia's largest last-mile logistics company.

I was born in India but grew up in Singapore, where I served in the army as part of National Service for 2 years between 19 and 20. I graduated in 2019 from the National University of Singapore, where I majored in Computer Engineering. I also masqueraded as a polymath at the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP). At USP, I co-headed [The Sessions](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/life-at-usp/interest-groups/239-the-sessions), USP's premier platform for conversations about topics including (but not limited to) politics, philosophy, technology, transport, sustainability, and education. 

I spent my second year of university interning at [Epic!](www.getepic.com), an educational technology start-up in California. I worked primarily as an iOS developer, but also occasionaly on the PHP back-end. 

My main interests are programming and technology, reading (mostly non-fiction), writing, traveling, and sports.
