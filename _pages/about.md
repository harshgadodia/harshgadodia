Hello there! My name is Harsh Gadodia. I'm a software engineer at [Ninja Van](www.ninjavan.co), Southeast Asia's largest and fastest growing last-mile logistics company.

I graduated summer 2019 from the National University of Singapore with an Honours degree in [Computer Engineering](http://www.ceg.nus.edu.sg/admissions/exploreceg.html#what). I was also part of the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg) (USP) at NUS, a selective multi-disciplinary honors programme. At USP, I co-headed [The Sessions](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/life-at-usp/interest-groups/239-the-sessions), USP's premier platform for conversations about topics including (but not limited to) politics, ethics, technology, transport, sustainability, and education.

My main interests are programming/[hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) (not [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker)), writing, travelling, current affairs, and soccer. Here are some of my favourite [reads](#reads), [movies and TV shows](#movies), and [quotes](#quotes).
