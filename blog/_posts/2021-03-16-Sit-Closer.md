16 March 2021

I've been working full time as a software engineer for a little less than 2 years now, and I like to think I've picked up many heuristics and meta-skills along the way to improve the way I code, communicate, document, estimate the complexity and time required for tasks (still hard!), prioritize, and tackle problems.

However, I think the most impactful moment for me over the past few years was the humble act of moving down to sit closer to the CTO. I think sitting close to someone you respect and would like to learn from as an underrated way to get better at whatever you want to do.

Sitting closer to the CTO has allowed me to better appreciate how someone responsible for hundreds of engineers and the overall technology of a company spends their time, energy, and brain power. It has enabled me to, in a small way, emulate him and elevate my own contributions to match the pace and impact of his.

Tip: You don't have to sit next to the CTO/CEO/CAnything at your organization, just someone you respect and want to be more like would probably do the trick.
