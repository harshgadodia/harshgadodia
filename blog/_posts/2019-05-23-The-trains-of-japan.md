I loved many things about Japan, but my favourite was the Shinkansen (bullet train) by far. They are an absolute engineering marvel, the best in the world at safety, punctuality, and technology. 

There have been zero fatalities aboard the bullet trains in over fifty years of operation, the trains travel at close to 300 km/h, and the average annual delay per train is 0.9 minutes, *including* natural disasters. 

These trains are representative of the Japanese culture in many ways, including a radical thirst for perfection and a devotion to craftsmanship.
