3 June 2020

Today marks a year of working full-time as a software engineer. With the caveat that I'm not an excellent engineer yet, here are some reflections of the past year, presented as advice to myself if I could time travel to one year ago.

1. Software Engineering is hard  
   Don't be fooled by people around you who claim to just get it, they've put in their due diligence. It's normal to experience many moments of helplessness at the start, but I think that with experience and expertise, these moments will start to get rarer. You will feel yourself not just getting better at solving problems you've seen before, but also at those you haven't. This is because as a software engineer whose job is to solve complex problems, you're not just learning - you're also learning to learn. Frameworks, libraries, languages, tools, methodologies, technologies will necessarily change faster than you can keep up unless you try. The world of technology is a fast-paced and constantly evolving one. The learning can never stop, and you need to accept that.
   

2. Ask for advice  
   Talk to senior engineers. Talk to engineers you respect. Watch how they work. Asking for advice is not just a great way to learn things the easier way, but it also gets senior engineers invested in your growth. Do note though that if you're always asking someone for advice and never following through, you're doing one of three things: asking the wrong person for advice, lacking discipline, or just a jerk.

3. 2 categories of problems  
    From my short experience in software engineering, I think there are 2 categories of problems you generally face as a software engineer. Let's call them Category A and Category B. Category A problems are problems that you can figure out yourself with a tangible amount of effort, in a short period of time. Some examples of such problems are figuring out the syntax of a for loop in a new programming language, learning the difference between errors and exceptions, and understanding small functions in a codebase.  
    
    Category B problems, however, are quite different. You will not be able to solve these problems immediately, no matter how hard you try right now. This is because these problems are abstract in nature and require contextual knowledge, experience, and presume understanding of certain concepts that you might not currently have. For these problems, the best thing to do is to "suspend understanding", try to understand just enough to get by right now, and revisit it next season. Alternatively, you can ask someone who understands the problem to explain it to you, and try to get as much as you can.  
    
    Some examples of Category B problems include understanding design patterns, containerization, and how database migrations work. Sometimes, you don't even know which category the problem you are facing fits into. I think that this gets better with experience, just like many things. Furthermore, in the words of my mentor, "It takes a while before you make a good guess." As you understand and solve more problems, you'll get better at solving unknown problems too, especially because you know where to start.

4. Looking back and feeling embarrassed  
    There are many moments when I look back at code I wrote months or weeks ago, and feel embarrassed by either my approach to solving the problem or why I didn't get there faster. Don't be mistaken - this is a great thing. If you're embarrassed, you've grown. You've understood concepts. You've digested information. You're no longer that same engineer.

5. Reading code  
    Writing code is hard. Reading code is even harder. For me, one of the hardest things is not writing code, but reading code. Reading code requires you to step into the minds of the multiple engineers who have worked on the codebase before you, and think like them. This is not a skill that comes easily, but definitely a skill that is necessary to excel as an engineer. It'd be foolish to think you'd be working on green fields projects for the rest of your life. Sit down and train on this skill. When you're really stuck, git blame and ask the person who wrote the code if they're still around about what they were doing. Chances are, you'll learn a new way of approaching problems.

6. JFGI  
    Stay away from engineers whose response to your every question is to ask you to ["jfgi"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jfgi). While it's not nice to run to someone for help every time you face a problem that you could figure out yourself, it's also not ideal if senior engineers are not interested in helping you out at all too. When you're new or inexperienced, there are just too many things you don't know, and you might not know where to start. In these situations, some guidance can go a long way. Some of the best teachings I've gotten are not just how to solve a bug, but how to diagnose and analyse so you can get there yourself. Do be respectful and not disrupt someone else's state of flow when asking questions, and preferably group questions together so it's less distracting for the other party. This is even more important right now when everyone is working remotely and you can't physically see if someone else is busy or already off work. And of course, please play that part for the new face once you know what you're doing. 

7. Contributions  
    I often felt small and insignificant because of how little code I was contributing at the start of my career. I still feel like that sometimes. However, I feel like the more you know and the more you learn, the faster you'll be able to contribute. In other words, your contributions will grow exponentially with your growth. While the workplace is not a university where your raison d'Ãªtre is to learn, it's perfectly fine to spend time sharpening the knife as long as it's in the spirit of what you do. I think it's important to pick up new projects and work breadth-wise, especially at the start. Specializing so early on is over rated, or rather, doesn't even make sense if you don't even know what the options are. That's bold.

8. Invest in your tools  
    Sometimes it's harder to see the big picture, but investing in tools, both hardware and software, will pay off in the long run. Instead of hacking away at problems, spend some time and money on resources that will make your life easier. If you're going to be staring at a monitor 12 hours a day for the next 5 years, it probably makes sense to get one that you enjoy looking at. If you're going to be using an IDE/text editor a lot, it's probably worth it to spend some time getting to know the shortcuts, and how you can customise the tools. It's probably also worth exploring tools that have stood the test of time, like Vim. People claim it can match the speed at which you think.

9. Burning out  
    I think the feeling of burning out is normal. I've rarely, if ever, met engineers who never burn out, but that's because they're exceptional and derive intense motivation and energy from what they dp. I don't think that automatically means that those who do burn out are less passionate though. When I feel burnt out, I take a couple of days off. I turn off notifications, and stay away from the computer. I go on walks without my phone. In less than a week, I'm raring to go again. That's how I know I'm passionate about what I do.

I think we're extremely fortunate to be in this field at a time where it's cool to know how to code, hardware is mature and not a consideration in most situations, and resources are plenty. I think the internet has brought more disruption to our lives in the past two decades than anything else in the past 6 million. It's exhilarating to think about what the next few decades have in store for us - or more precisely, where we, software engineers, decide to take technology. I personally got into software engineering because I was mind blown by how much one can create and express themselves with a computer and internet access. Exciting times ahead!
