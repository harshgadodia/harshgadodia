3 June 2021

Time flies, and it's been another year working as a software engineer for me.

When I last wrote a [similar post](https://harshgadodia.com/blog/Reflections-on-1-Year-of-Software-Engineering/) a year ago, I focused on reflecting on my one year in the industry, asking myself, what did I wish I knew before I started?

In this post, I'd like to be less formal. I'll instead mention things that have surprised me, things I've learnt about myself, praise myself (just a little), and talk about what keeps me motivated. Maybe you will be able to relate, and learn from my insights.

1. What can't be solved tonight will be solved tomorrow morning


2. Self-confidence + Enthusiam + Effort make you unstoppable (Everything is figureoutable)

3. Haters gonna hate
4. Being in two different teams at the same company can lead to an experience as different as being in two different companies
5. The power of distraction
6. Things that I've learnt about myself
  1. over engineering does not excite me
  2. I'm naturally good at communicating
  3. I learn best by doing
