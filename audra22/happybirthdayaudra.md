Chapter 22: A Pot of Gold at the End of the Rainbow

A friend of mine might be an alien.

She does not seem to understand how the world works. She trusts everyone as if she has never been hurt before, and somehow never fails to see the good in a person. Even after they let her down.

She only believes in bad situations, and never in bad intentions. 

It's hard to make her mad. I've never succeeded, and I've made many people mad.

She's wise well beyond her age (in human years), but somehow fails to understand the potency of her abilities.

She's distant from humans in many other ways too. She seems to have no ego, always apologising to people even before they have a chance to get angry. 

She's tall, sings like an angel, dances, takes photos, makes videos, writes beautifully, and masters many of the arts with ease. Yet, she's nervous around others and thinks she's not good enough in many things. I don't understand her.

She thinks that boys talk to her because they are interested in a conversation.

She thinks everyone should be an artist.

She asks many, many questions. She's curious about everything.

She's picky about who she considers her friends. She even made me question what friendship meant.

She loves the summer and wants to absorb every last bit of sunshine. She can go on for many hours without food or rest. Perhaps, she's closer to a plant than she is to a human.

Here are some of my memories with her (in no particular order).

1. Chatting all the way to Bali on the plane like long lost friends.
2. Getting a good morning text every morning followed by being asked to study together in Cinnamon.
3. Going to Gardens by the Bay during recess week together with Amelie.
4. Staying at my house and chilling together for a few days before she left Singapore.
5. Getting prata at the Indian Stall in Utown.
6. Eating shitty vegetarian food (but in a good ambience) in Bali.
7. Talking about friendship on many occasions in Cinammon.
8. Noticing her for the first time in Chatterbox, lying down on the couch and reading a magazine.
9. Randomly planning a trip to Bali because of a certain friends ditching at the last moment.
10. Meeting for the first time in the dining hall over Breakfast.
11. Having intense discussions about politics, and then one party accusing the other of not knowing more than the other just because they're not a political science student.
12. Arguing about being ignored over text.
13. Drunk (only one party) conversations over text with deep questions.
14. Getting almost attacked (and then saved) by dogs in Bali.
15. Long walks on the beaches of Bali, one party having to drag the other.
16. Arguing about showing text messages to third parties.
17. Playing dance dance in the theme room.
18. Watching the Kecak Dance at the Uluwatu Temple (and only one of us enjoying the weird singing)
19. Walks to cheers to get snacks at odd hours.
20. Video conversations maintaining online friendships.
21. Receiving the most thoughtful birthday wish in the form of a powerpoint presentation.
22. Taking a long walk and talking about friendship instead of being in Pulau Ubin camping.

Happy birthday! You're the best.
