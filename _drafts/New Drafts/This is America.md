2017 was an interesting year for me, having had the chance to live in the states for a year as an intern at a tech company. When I look back on the year, I can think of many great memories, but if I try to think of the one thing that really represented America to me, it would be a humble sign outside the shared swimming pool in the apartment complex where I stayed.

*The use of alchol and drugs near the pool is not encouraged*.
