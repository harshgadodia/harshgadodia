# Libraries and Bookstores

One big, black, coffee and two hours to kill in a bookstore led me to the realisation: bookstores and libraries are *vastly* different places. In fact, the similarity between the two ends where they both pack countless books within their four walls.

The main difference between the two is how they arrange books, and understanding why that is so helps us understand why visiting a bookstore and a library is such a different experience. Bookstores are trying to sell you, well, books, and hence have curated an experience for you as such. This means that books are organised in the most appealing possible manner, with best-sellers and popular topics always within reach. This makes bookstores the window-shoppers paradise.

Libraries, on the other hand, are designed for you to find a book you're looking for. The no-nonsense Dewey Decimal system is designed to help you find a book you already know you want, but not quite help you chance upon your next great read.
