1 year of software engineering 

- it is hard
- ask for advice 
- 10x = make others feel great about themselves, mentorship
- constantly reading and learning 
- exponentially contributions and seniority
- feeling helpless
- writing code is hard, reading code is even harder
- there are 2 kinds of problems, sometimes its better to suspend understanding and try to do it first, if oyu cant, the next best thing is to draw a diagram to test your understanging and explain is to someone else. at other times, understanding every single line is necessary. sometimes its hard to know which to do. i think that will get better with experience.
- if you look back to what you were working on, and dont understand why you were'nt able to do it earlier, you're likely on the right track
- JFGI
- it is normal to not like it some days. but as long as you like it more than you dont like it, you're good
