Today marks a year of working professionally as a software engineer. With the caveat that I'm not an excellent engineer, here are some reflections of the past year. 

1. Software Engineering is hard. 
   Don't be fooled by people around you who claim to just get it, they've put in the due diligence. It's normal have many moments of helplessness at the start, but I think that with experience and expertise, these moments will start to get rarer. You will feel yourself not just getting better at solving problems you've seen before, but also at those you haven't. This is because as a software engineer whose job is to solve complex problems, you're not just learning - you're also learning to learn. The world of technology is a fast-paced and constantly evolving one. The learning will never stop, and you need to accept that. Frameworks, libraries, languages, developer tools, methodologies, technologies will necessarily change faster than you can keep up. 

2. Ask for advice. 
   Talk to senior engineers. Talk to engineers you respect. Watch how they work. Asking for advice is not just a great way to learn things the easier way, but also gets senior engineers invested in your growth. Do note though that if you're always asking someone for advice and never doing the things they say, you're doing one of three things: asking the wrong person for advice, lacking the discipline to follow through, or just a jerk.

3. 2 category of problems
    From my short experience software engineering (including 4 years of university), I think there are 2 categories of problems you can face as a software engineer. Let's call them Category A and Category B. Category A problems are problems that you can figure out yourself with a tangible amount of effort, in a short period of time. Some examples of such problems are figuring out the syntax of a new programming language, learning the difference between errors and exceptions, and understanding small functions in a codebase. Category B problems, however, are quite different. These problems, no matter how hard you try right now, you will not be able to solve immediately. This is because these problems are abstract in nature and require contextual knowledge, experience, and presume understanding of certain concepts that you might not currently have. For these problems, the best thing to do is to "suspend understanding", try to understand just enough to get by, and revisit it next season. Alternatively, you can ask some who understands the problem to explain it to you.  Some example of problems like this include understanding design patterns, containerization and orchestration, and learning front-end. Sometimes, you don't even know which category the problem you are facing fits into. I think that gets better with experience, just like many things.

4. Looking back and feeling embarrassed
    There are many moments where I look back at code I wrote months ago, and sometimes weeks ago, and feel  embarrassed by what either how I was solving the problem or why I didn't get there faster. Don't be mistaken - this is a great thing. If you're embarrassed, you've grown. You've understood concepts. You've digested information. You're no longer that same engineer.

5. Reading code
    Writing code is hard. Reading code is even harder. For me, one of the hardest things is not writing code, but reading code. Reading code requires you to step into the minds of the multiple engineers who have worked on the codebase before you, and think like them. This is not a skill that comes easily, but definitely a skill that is necessary to excel as an engineer. It'd be foolish to think you'd be working on green fields projects for the rest of your life.

6. Burning out
    I think the feeling of burning out is normal. I've rarely if ever met engineers who never burn out, but that's because they're exceptional and derive intense motivation and energy from writing code. I don't think that automatically means that those who do burn out are less passionate though. When I feel burnt out, I take a couple of days off. I turn off slack and work notifications, and stay away from the computer. I go on walks, without my phone. In less than a week, I'm raring to go again. That's how I know I'm passionate about what I do.

7. JFGI
    Stay away from engineers whose response to your every question is to Just F Google It. While it's not fair to run to someone for help every time you face a problem, it's also not ideal if senior engineers are not interested in helping you out at all. Especially when you're new or inexperienced, there are just too many things you don't know, and you don't know where to start. In these situations, some guidance can go a long way. Do be respectful and not disrupt someone else's state of flow when asking questions, and preferably group them together so it's less distracting for the other party. Of course, please play that part for the new face when you know what you're doing. 

8. Contributions 
    I often felt small because of how little code I was contributing at the start. I still feel like that sometimes. However, I feel like the more you know and the more you learn, the faster you'll be able to contribute. In other words, your contributions will grow exponentially with your learnings. While the workplace is not a university where your raison d'Ãªtre is to learn, it's perfectly fine to spend time sharpening the knife as long as you are keeping up with your responsibilities. I think it's important to pick up new projects and work breadth-wise, especially at the start. Specializing is over rated, or rather, doesn't even make sense if you don't even know what the possibilities are.
