# Prof A and Prof B

*Have you heard of the mythical(?) [10x programmer](http://antirez.com/news/112)?*

In the past four years of university, I have taken classes at NUS under the tutelege of about forty professors. About ten percent of them stood out to me as wonderful educators. Two, in particular, had a huge impact on both my classroom learning and post-class outlook. Let's call them Prof A and Prof B.

What made them such great educators?

I realised during the lessons, and later confirmed upon reflection, that both Prof A and Prof B were there to learn from us students as much as they were there to teach. For example, Prof A took down notes for himself when students said something that he thought was worth revisting himself. Prof B spent some time in the first class of the semester asking students how they intended to contribute to the class, and what each individual could bring. This baffled many students in the class. Both of these examples illustrate a thirst for knowledge, a hunger for self-improvement, and the humility to learn from their students.

Furthermore, both Prof A and Prof B also expected a lot more from students compared to other professors. The classes taught by these two professors had both the the most number of graded assignments, and also the greatest variety of assignments amongst all the classes in my candidature. It was no coincidence that their classes had the highest workloads, though. More work for me was definitely more work for them, but they were more than just fine with it. They pushed us hard, while expecting no less from themselves.

I see these professors as 10x educators, if I may coin a term. 10x programmers may produce 10 times the output of a normal programmer, but just imagine the rippling benefits brought by 10x educators - inspiring and training the next generation of thinkers and practioners of their fields. I also some of them aspire to
