# Prof A and Prof B

In the past four years of university, I have taken classes at NUS under the tutelege of about forty professors. While I believe that the teaching standard at NUS is generally poor for various reasons (including over-reliance on powerpoint slides, blatant reuse of materials semester after semester, and prioritising grading students over their learning) some professors have stood out to me as wondeful educators. Two, in particular, had a huge impact on both my classroom learning and post-class outlook. Let's call them Prof A and Prof B.

What made them such great educators?

I realised during the lessons, and later confirmed upon reflection, that both Prof A and Prof B were there to learn as much as they were there to teach. For example, Prof A took down notes for himself when students said something that he thought was worth giving additional thought. A teacher regularly taking notes in class, who would have thought! Prof B spent some time in the first class of the semester asking students what they intended to contribute to the class. This baffled many students in the class. Both of these examples illustrate a thirst for knowledge and self-improvement.

Both Prof A and Prof B also expected a lot more from students than other professors I took classes from. The classes taught by these two professors had both the the most number of graded assignments, and also the greatest variety of assignments amongst all the classes in my candidature. It was no coincidence that their classes had the highest workloads, though. More work for me was definitely more work for them, but this workload was a testament to their desire to impart to us as much knowledge as they could. 

What makes them great
1. They want to learn from you 
2. High expectations, high workload, but also willing to work harder
3. Great variety of assignments
4. Quick-witted, sharp sense of humour, showing one their place
