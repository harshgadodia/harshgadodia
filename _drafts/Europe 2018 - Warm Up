It was March this year that I decided to spend much of my summer break 2018 backpacking through Europe. Having a friend who was already interning in Stockholm for the past one year made it a whole lot easier to make the leap. In this and the next few posts, I will share stories, tips, and experiences that *hopefully* will transcend a mere transcription of my travels. My aim is to share my experiences, hopefully in a way that is useful to you, the reader.

I started off my journey flying directly from Singapore to London via Norwegian Air. This flight is supposed to the longest budget flight in the world, and I did not know what to expect - however, I do have to say that I have absolutely no complaints for the price I paid (around 500 SGD from Singapore to London, and then London to Stockholm inclusive). Meals were served on time and the plane was brand new. One small tip may be to bring your own 3.5mm jack headphones if you wish to enjoy the in-flight entertainment. Norwegian Air also lands at Gatwick Airport instead of Heathrow for most premium airlines, but they are both pretty much equidistant from the city centre.

I arrived in London after about 15 hours and **obviously** bought a 20GB data sim from Vodafone, which works freely in the entire "Europe Zone" for about 25 pounds. The train from Gatwick Airport to the city cost about 14 pounds, which is probably the cheapest way to get to London if you don't have a friend to pick you up.

London is one of the largest, most densely populated, and culturally rich places in the world, and often the first pit stop for backpackers heading deeper into Europe. People have been coming to London for the museums, pubs, theatre, royalty, and history for generations, and it's easy to see why. In my short few days (and my second time in London), I did most of the high-key touristy things, and enjoyed all of it almost equally. I'm personally not a big fan of royalty because I don't believe in celebrating the luckiest sperm over generations, so Buckingham Palace wasn't in my list for sure - I did however walk past the palace. My main motivation being in London was actually to spend time with my childhood friend Daksh, and it was great seeing him and spending his after-work hours with me. His mum was around and she made some amazing food for us, and World Cup Seasons meant exciting evenings. World Cup season would last deep through my journey, and the finals would be whilst I was in Spain - this surely made me wish they were in the finals! 

My time in Stockholm was pretty eye-opening though. It was my first time in Scandinavia and although I was warned about how expensive it was going to be, it was still shocking anyways. I paid about 15 bucks for fast food for lunch, and it was the only meal I had outside. Public transport is decent although expensive, and that is how one would go around the city - cabs are very expensive. The main highlight in Stockholm is supposed to be [Vasa Museum](https://www.vasamuseet.se/en), which is basically a large building with an almost perfectly-restored viking ship (The Vasa). The ship sank in the 17th century because of human arrogance (King Gustav wanted a grand ship better than the Danish's), human stupidity (the two different sides of the ship were built by two different groups of builders who used the length of their hands for measurement, and they had different hand sizes because they were of different races) and engineering mistakes (the ship was designed too tall and too heavy to float effectively). Before visiting Vasa Museum, you should know that the entire museum is about this salvaged ship, and at around 30 dollars, I personally didn't find it quite worth the money. The ship would have barely been a single exhibit in any other museum, but it was the entirety of the Vasa Museum.

I also visited Skansen, which is an open-air zoo and museum. It was a pretty interesting experience and cost around the same as the Vasa, but had a lot more things to do. While some things were paid inside Skansen after paying the basic entry free, most were free. It is a giant space, and one could easily spend an entire day walking around the park. The zoo had a decent variety of animals (decent because it is hard to compete with the Singapore Zoo, frequently lauded as world's best, and other zoos overseas that have five horses and call themselves a zoo). Skansen's zoo was in between. They had animals like wolves, bears, otters, lions, and bison. My short 2 days in Stockholm were interesting because although I didn't do much, I did get to learn about how the Swedes live - they are family oriented - I hear they have like 6 weeks of normal leave a year, have **two years** of childcare leave that they can use before the child is five, not including weekends - making it about two and a half years effectively. They believe in gender equality, and most companies strive to ensure an equal distribution of men and women in the workforce. Most people wrap up work around 4pm, after which they pick a picnic spot to hang out with their family. The Swedes take their family time very seriously for sure. Studies are very heavily subsidized in Sweden, and many have Masters and PHDs. Degrees don't feature class honours, and everyone in society is equally respected. A very different system from what we have in Singapore, with more emphasis on work life, grades, and status.

I am super excited for my journey to the rest of Europe!
