# Libraries and Bookstores

Libraries and bookstores are seemingly alike. However, they are *vastly* different places - the similarity between the two ends where they both pack countless books within their four walls.

Libraries are designed as first and foremost, a place of reference. The Dewey Decimal System organizes library material by discipline, making it easy to find books you already know you want. Looking for a book in the local library is similar to finding a word in your trusty dictionary (yes, the thick, dusty kind). 

Bookstores, on the other hand, arrange books in the most appealing manner possible. This makes the browsing experience tantalising, and helps maximise sales. Furthermore, good bookstores also invest thought in designing the browsing experience for customers from the start to the end. Walking from the entrance of the store to the cashier feels like an experience, thoughtful curation forcing one to stop and flip over books on the way. A good bookstore should make you feel like buying many more books than you came for.

The next time you're undecided on what books you want to read, go to a quality bookstore. If you're unscrupulous like me, take down the names of the books you like, and head to the library next. I promise it'll be easy to find those books, thanks to Melvil Dewey.
