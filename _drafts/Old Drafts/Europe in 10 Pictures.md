## I'm no photographer, but a picture speaks a thousand words. Here are some no-nonsense pictures I took with my iPhone around France, Spain and Italy, complete with some context.

<img src= "/assets/bridgeOfSighs.jpg" width="100000000"> 

1. The Bridge of Sighs is an infamous arch bridge that connects the Doge's Palace to its prisons. It is named as such because condemned prisoners had their last view of Venice (and freedom) from this bridge before they met their executioners. Sigh indeed.

2. This is the patio of the Palace of Charles V. It was taken at the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Alhambra literally means "Red One" in Arabic, and was built in the time when Spain was rules by Muslims.

3. The Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi√®re is a minor basilica in Lyon. It is dedicated to Virgin Mary who is believed to have saved the city from the Black Death, which killed 30-60% of Europe's population.

4. Still unfinished 136 years later, the Sagrada Familia is a Roman Catholic church designed by Antonio Gaudi. He died in 1926, when less than a quarter of the project was finished, after being run over by a tram. A sad way to die for someone who saw the church as the work of his lifetime. 

<img src= "/assets/eiffel.jpg" width="100000000"> 

5. The Eiffel Tower, an 81-storey tower built in 1889, was supposed to be a temporary structure. Many artists and engineers protested the design of the tower, and never wanted it built. It is now the most visited paid monument in the world, with 7 million visitors in 2015. Way to answer to haters.

<img src= "/assets/burano.jpg" width="100000000"> 

6. The brightly coloured houses of Burano, now a major attraction for tourists to Venice, were painted for a more practical purpose in the past - to be more visible to fishermen in a fog. Today, strict regulations govern what colours each house can be painted as, and no adjacent houses can be painted in the same colour.

<img src= "/assets/murano.jpg" width="100000000">  

7. No two pieces of work are the same from the glass factories of world-famous Murano. Murano's Glass Masters have a minimum of 15-20 years of experience. Everything is learnt through apprenticeship - no student loans necessary, and the exact composition of raw materials used to make the beautiful glass items is a secret. 

<img src= "/assets/tarifa.jpg" width="100000000"> 

8. The southern most point in Europe and only 12 km away from Morocco in Africa, Tarifa is a beautiful beach town that is a hidden gem. On clear, calm days, you possibly can see whales and dolphins from the coast. Here we can see a humpback breaching.

<img src= "/assets/alcazar.jpg" width="100000000"> 

9. Real Alcazar de Sevilla is a palace built for the Chrisrtian King Peter of Castile from the ruins of a Muslim residential fortress. You may recognize it as The Water Gardens of Dorne from the Game of Thrones. Possibly a spoiler?

10. Le Mer de Canuts in Croix-Rousse, Lyon is a huge mural on the side of a residential building. It is said to be Europe's largest fresco. Dating back to 1986, it has now been updated to reflect the changes in the neighbourhood since.
