## I haven't showered in 3 days, nor have I seen slept in that long. I would be lying if I said I am able to type this article without spell-checker and auto-correct doing some very heavy lifting.

*In the past 48 hours, my friend and I have experienced 2 of probably the worst possible things that can happen to a tourist - getting our belongings stolen, and getting a flight canceled without being re-booked, with our replacement flight tickets being cancelled by kiwi.com for suspicion of being "fraudulent transactions"*

The nightmare began an evening in Brussels, Belgium. Having spent the last night at the Athens airport to save some dough, my friend and I were already pretty tired. We had wrapped up a pretty awesome day walking around Brussels, and had especially enjoyed an insightful tour of the European Parliament in Brussels. Having had a nice dinner in Pizza Hut, we wanted to get a couple of Belgian beers and sit in the city centre, and chill for a bit. That night was going to become another night at the airport, and our flight was at 6.30am. 

Sitting-down and being tired of people-watching, we decided to play Heads-up to kill some time (and decide who would get the next round). Our bags were between us on the park bench, and my pal Shubz left his camera on the other side of his body, well within arms' length. While playing the game, we saw someone come and sit beside him, and he left after a couple of minutes. We think the man was of African ancestry by his skin tone. 

After a couple of rounds in, Shubz said that he wanted to check on our belongings, and that's when we realized it - the camera was gone. Thousands of dollars of equipment, but infinitesimal compared to what was inside the camera, almost all our pictures from the past month of this trip. Hundreds of hours spent in the hot sun by Shubz over the past month (and me providing moral support), all gone just like that. For me, taking pictures whilst traveling has always been to serve as a physical take-away memory, but to Shubz, photography was the end-goal of this month in Europe. I travel to see new places and broaden my horizon, and take pictures to share with others. Shubz, however, travels to take photos. He plans his entire day around where he needs to be at what time in the day to take that perfect shot. He climbs fences into private properties, jumps over barricades, and camps in the hot sun with hundreds of like-minded tourists around him, all for that perfect shot. All that effort, all gone, just like that. In broad daylight, too.

*Shubz, if you're reading this, I have no words to express how terrible I feel, but I know that I don't know the half of it. I know it could have well been me instead of you having had something stolen. I also hope that you this incident does not scare you in any way with regards to traveling, or diminishes that crazy passion for photography in your soul. It's an inspiration to me, and I'm sure many others. Keep at it buddy, and I'm sorry.*

To top it off, the Belgian police were absolutely useless. I tried to beg them to follow me to the site so that they could see for themselves the site of the crime, but they instead told me to head back there myself and call the police hotline if we see the suspect. Because he'll obviously be in the area after stealing the camera, right?
