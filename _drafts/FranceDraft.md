## Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect from my 9 days in France (Paris, Lyon, Nice, Cannes and Marseille). 

Being the first stop of my 5 weeks of backpacking after short stints in London and Stockholm, I was definitely excited to get up and running. I did, however, have mixed feelings as well because of what I had been told about the French and France. The French are notorious for being rude to English-speakers, and I was worried about my belongings - petty crimes are common in France, especially in the bigger cities. Well, I was on holiday, and determined to get my money's worth, I set out with a smile on my face.

Having last been to Paris 10 years ago for the first time, I kind of knew what to expect. The fashion capital of the world continues to draw millions of visitors to attractions such as the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and Champs-Élysées. We added to those numbers. Crowded, kind if dirty, and clearly overpopulated, the French capital of the world continues to charm its visitors for some reason that I cannot pen. The city of love has an aura about it, and it is as if time stops when you are in Paris (especially when you are trying to buy tickets to the tip of the Eiffel). Despite the number of tourists and many touts, walking along the Seine is still pleasant, and the views from the Eiffel Tower still blow you away. The city has managed to somehow retain its charm even while bursting at its seams.

We took an overnight bus from Paris to Lyon - tiring, but very cheap, and saves you one night of accommodations. Being in Lyon felt like being in a different part of the world. Unlike Paris, Lyon is  more organised, cheaper, and tourists are fewer and further in between. The third-largest city in France with half a million inhabitants, part of Lyon is a UNSECO world heritage site for the "exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance." The most iconic attraction in Lyon is the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, a beautiful church that sits atop a hill. We would eventually find out that practically every town in France has a church dedicated to this "Notre Dame", or Virgin Mary in English. She is believed to have miraculously cured the Lyonnais of the Black Plague, which killed 30-60% of Europe's population. Not being able to understand French was a huge disadvantage because all the boards of information in the church were in French, but fortunately a very kind lady who worked in the Church walked me around and explained to me every but of the church in great detail. I was extemely humbled by the experience, especially because although she was not very good with English, she tried her absolute best to get her point across - using a medley facial expressions, hand gestures, and at points, simply hoping that the French words and English words for things were the same (they often were, with just different pronunciations). It was an important reminder to me, to not judge people beforehand. I also then realised that it was the Parisians who give the French their bad reputation, and it would be unfair to judge France by Paris, because perhaps New-Yorkers are much worse, and they don't represent all of America.

After Lyon, we headed to the beautiful French Riviera, or Cote de Azur. This Mediterranean coastline extends from Toulon to the France-Italy border, and includes Monaco. Once the playground of the wealthy British upper-class, and then of the Russian and other aristocrats, the beaches of the riviera now attract non-royal people from all over the world too. We spent a few days in Nice, Cannes, and then Marseille. 

The 2 days we spent in Nice, I was somehow strangely convinced that we were in Italy. I later learnt that the French strong-armed Italy into giving up Nice to them as repayment for a wartime favour. Nice is in beautiful, and it has a nice boardwalk, Old Town, and also great beaches. We found ourselves at a pebble-beach, a non-sandy beach close to where we had our Airbnb. While strange at first, I ended up enjoying the non-sandiness of the beach and the therapeutic effect of walking on pebbles. 

Cannes, now world-famous for the Cannes film festival that happens there every year, was another beautiful city on the coast. Counting people such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso, Queen Victoria of England, and Bono, this city is also known for its luxurious hotels and residences, famous residents, and host to several conferences. An ideal spot for spotting luxury cars, I enjoyed walking into some of the nice hotels on the beach front to take a peek and also find shelter from the hail (in summer too!). Cannes also has the beautiful Lerins islands off its coast. I visited Île Sainte-Marguerite, with an impressive fortress-prison and beaches you can snorkle at. While we were in Cannes and trying to find our way to a top-rated (and reasonably priced) soup restaurant, we walked into a police station to ask for directions. We were first asked if we spoke French (in French), to which we replied no (in English). We were them asked if we spoke Spanish, and then Italian. Upon realising that we only spoke English, the police woman looked at us and sand "alalalalala" in disappointment, which we found hilarious! We then realised that it is a very common French term to express awe, shock, or disappointment in a candid manner. We eventually found our way to the restaurant and ordered soups each. They were fridge-cold, which was something we were not expecting. It was kind of nice in the hot summer weather, though.

We then found ourselves in Marseille, the second-largest city in France. Amongst all the cities in France, I have to say this was the worst by far. With not much to do other than a port with expensive restaurants and *another* Notre-Dame church at the top of the hill. On our way to the top of the hill where the church sat in a bus, we saw a police car race behind us, making our bus pull-over. Following this, everyone was made to leave the bus one by one by the police, who checked identification and personal belongings of everyone on the bus. This was without any explanation, but the entire process did not take much longer than 15 minutes. While not the worst thing, it was definitely strange. If you're reading this, I would highly recommend skipping Marseille altogether if you're visiting the riviera. Perhaps Parc national des Calanques is the only place really worth being in Marseille for. A few hours away from Marseille by boat (or a pretty long bus/car journey + hike), the national park really reminded me of the chalky mountains of Yosemite.

Tips for France: 
	1. Even if you don't speak French, starting with "Bonjour" makes a difference, its just a little sign of respect
	2. If you think someone is pretending to not understand English, just start to speak to them in a third language. They will magically start to understand English then.
	3. Strikes in France are now pretty much a way of life. They are extremely annoying, and you will only know, with trains, if your train is affected by strikes at 5pm the day before you travel. 
	4. Presenting identification as an EU student usually means heavy discounts at all attractions. Some are outright free.
	5. If you like to live dangerously, you don't have to pay for public transport at all in France. I've seen that many locals jump the gates or just enter buses without paying, especially through the back entrance in buses.
