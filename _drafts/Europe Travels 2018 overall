1. London

	* Quite a few things to do, really hot, spent most time with Daksh. Very nice place. Super easy to commute by public transport around London and it's not very expensive. Everyone is very well dressed to work, even thought it is really hot. Big Ben under construction. Super great food at auntie's place.

2. Stockholm

	* Things are few and far apart, people are not really friendly because they are reserved, family oriented, lots of leaves things like that. Community oriented. Vasa Museum, but literally only one thing in the entire museum and that is about it lol. Learn to enjoy the nature around you.

FRANCE IN GENERAL

	* very friendly *if* you begin with Bonjour, and you should respect that
	* people go our of their way to help you 
	* rail/plane strikes annoying as hell - only announce at 5pm the previous day what trains are cancelled
	* lots of "Notre-Dame" churches - explain Virgin Mary story
	* don't have to tap for buses and trains if you like living dangerously, free/cheap entry for youths/students almost everywhere
	* trick in France - if people don't reply to you in English, just start to talk in Chinese/Hindi/Whatever and they will suddenly attain the ability to communicate in English

3. Paris too much to do for 2 full days, lots of tourists as expected, enjoyed Champs-Elysees the most. Sitting in Macdonalds people-watching. Louvre was beautiful as always, but again hot in the summer. AirBnb super far from city centre which was a huge waste of time + energy.

4. Lyon

Slower pace, very very hot, beautiful streets and friendly people, lady at the church gave us a private tour when we asked her a simple question _ talk about the history since I got to hear it + what religion vs spirituality. Girl in Lyon -> Nice bus told me that students striked about almost every single subject she took because they said it was "too hard".

AirBnB scammer broken bed, wrote me a review of lies and tried to get us to pay 120.

5. Nice

Pebble beaches, nice old town and boardwalk. Ice-cream place with 100 flavors.

Very nice long walks around Nice.

Federico, Music Producer for universal.

6. Cannes

Beautiful beaches, nice hotels, nice cars, lots to discover just by walking around, easy to understand why stars like it. Expensive, worth going to islands. Fancy cars and lots of rich people/celebrities. random guy screaming ca va at the beach. Cannes Musee De La Castre.

Super nice long walk between airbnb and practically everywhere.

Cold Soup, helpful policeman who guided us into the police station where lady said alalalalala when we didn't know French and Italian. Hilarious!

Very nice AirBnB host, made me put a pin where Singapore was, glad more people know where it is now.

No film museum?! dafuq

7. Marseille 
 
Scenic train ride from Cannes to Marseille

Nothing much to do in Marseille, dirtiest of all the cities so far. Saw the gay pride parade but that was it.

Tried a decent Ukrainian restaurant, but streets feel a little unsafe at night, even at 10pm. Mostly immigrants from Africa. No nonsense city with working people who do their thing and then go to sleep, perhaps not really for tourists, or perhaps it is not tourist season.

Perhaps Parc national des Calanques is the only place really worth being in Marseille for. Boat vs hiking
